# Virus_Simulation

Welcome on my GitHub,

because this is my first Repository, it may be a bit chaotic. 
Therefore my code will be found in the 'master' branch. 

This is made as a part of a school project and the competition 'Jugend forscht'. 
My Project contains a website, which can simulate a virus. It's still in work and can therefore hava a few bugs and problems.

If you have any suggestions for improvement, you can massage me at: 'justin.becker@avh.hamburg'.

I know the code is a bit messy but i am still learning a lot so i hope thats ok...

The website is avaible at the link: http://virsim.avh.hamburg/
(The code on the website can differ from the one on this github)


Have fun!
